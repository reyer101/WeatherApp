On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
- The code looks really clean and easy to understand! It took me a while to get the program able to run, since I had to do some weird installation command, since my computer didn't recognize the commands that the README asked to install, but once I was able to install everything, the program ran smoothly. Your main method was concise and all of your work was done in methods, which made the program extremely streamlined. The only thing I recommend is to have the README documented a bit more clearly in terms on how to install the necessary components as well as listing what role each member had.
