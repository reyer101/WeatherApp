On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
  The program seems like it will be great when it is finished, but at the moment the biggest
  issues is how you have to build it. The required libraries should be part of the file, and the
  README should be edited to have slightly more specific instructions.
