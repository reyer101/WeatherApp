On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficient instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
Alec's Portion from Readme: Handled all request functions to retrieve data from the api, added forecast functionality, worked on converting time and dates

Smart work with the API! Saved yourself a good amount of unnecessary work.  Program does everything that it's supposed to do and really easy to read.  Time base works as well.  Super easy to read too.  You were also the only person to actually put something in the readme file with your contribution so thank you for making my job easier.  Whoever made the walkthrough in the Readme, thank you.
