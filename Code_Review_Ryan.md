On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 1 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to install necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficient instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
The instructions given to install throw an error involving the import of requests.   
File "setup.py", line 9, in <module>
    from setuptools import setup
ImportError: No module named setuptools
To rectify this, you should add a section to the installation guide involving how to obtain these dependencies.
