On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to install necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficient instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
The changes to the compiling isntructions fixed all the errors I was having running the code. Works fine now. One thing I would recommend is that when you input a zip code, have the program display the City of the zip code you put in. That way if someone (for whatever reason) only knows their zip code, the program can tell them what city they put in.
